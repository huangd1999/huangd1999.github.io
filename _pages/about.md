I am a third-year PhD student (2021–present) in the Computer Science Department at The University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of Prof. [Heming Cui](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~heming/). I also closely collaborated with [Dr. Jie M.Zhang](https://sites.google.com/view/jie-zhang), [Dr. Xiaofei Xie](https://xiaofeixie.bitbucket.io/), and [Dr. Junjie Chen](https://tjusail.github.io/people/chenjunjie/).

Before my current program, I earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology with outstanding graduate honors.

I am broadly interested in code generation tasks, such as Multi-Agent Code Generation, Correctness,  Efficiency, Fairness of LLM-generated Code, and Reasoning in Code. Before that, I was focusing on the Trust AI systems, specifically in the development of testing techniques for deep learning systems. For my previous work and current code generation works, I prefer naming them as **testing** (e.g., testing the security, correctness, efficiency, and fairness).

 <!-- During my PhD study, I have dedicated myself to constructing deep learning testing frameworks and evaluating the fairness and efficiency of existing code generation models. My work has been published in several conferences and journals, including the ICLR, ICCV, ICRA, TOSEM, and TPDS, where I have served as the first author or corresponding author on three papers. -->
